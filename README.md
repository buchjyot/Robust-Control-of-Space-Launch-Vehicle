Robust Control of Space Launch Vehicle

# Abstract
This project involves study of a spacecraft launch vehicle attitude control problem. Several control design objectives of a reduced order launch vehicle are explored by understanding and applying robust control concepts. Fundamental trade off between performance and robustness is studied in this project.
